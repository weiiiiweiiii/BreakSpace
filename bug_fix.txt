+------------------------------------------------------+
 1. fixed bug #6:
	Multiple open does not save

	changed textRelatedObjects from class variable to 
	instance variable. Originally when opening a new file
	in a new window, textRelatedObjects (as a class variable
    	is modified in new window, which changes the OpenedFile
    	for the original window)

2. fixed bug #9:
	Shortcut not working properly when new TopLevel window is created. 
	- Close without save as;
	- Find window

	When bind command with Root Window(self.__root.bind(command = KEY)) has 
	the exactly same keys with accelerator in Menu Bar(accelerator = KEY)) 
	under the condition of popping out Top Level Window will cause bugs
